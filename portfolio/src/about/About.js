                I am a Full Stack Web Developer who is passionate about writing
                clean code and improving my users' lives. I want to make a
                difference in this world doing what I love.
                <br /><br />
                The spark to become a developer started when I was playing a
                mobile game thinking about how it was made and everything that went into
                it. I then purchased a starter kit on making phone apps. From
                there I enrolled in some computer science courses at the local
                college. It wasn't long after this that I learned about Lambda
                and completely immersed myself in code. At this point I am a
                young developer with much to learn but am anxious to learn and
                grow in the skills I have aquired.
